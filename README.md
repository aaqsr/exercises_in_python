My rather basic solutions and notes to the exercises and chapters of Introduction to Python for Science by David J. Pine. This is in no way intended to replicate his work in any way shape or form. I am simply posting my solutions of the exercises posed in the book, as a beginner to python. My solutions may not be the most efficient way. They are simply what I came up with.
